# Deep Learning

## Neural Networks

- imagenet -- image data
- Tenserflow
- one_hot:

  ```python
  mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("/tmp/data/", one_hot=True)

    # 10 classes, 0-9
    # the follow is just one_hot
    #
    # 0 = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    # 1 = [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    # 2 = [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    # ........
  ```
